###### Focus
*If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.*


I would take care to meet people on the team and to learn how to communicate with them effectively as a developer to help make the handoff stage easier. I’m still learning what industry I’m most interested in focusing in on as a developer, and to figure that out the exposure to many different projects while working at an agency would be ideal. I also want to learn how to communicate with clients. We wouldn’t have time to build the next Duolingo, but I want to learn how the planning stage for these projects happen as the only projects I’ve planned out are ones I made myself.
